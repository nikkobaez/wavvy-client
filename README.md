# wavvy-client

Wavvy - Fullstack Web Application: Allows users to search for other users, search their chats for a conversation, send, approve, or deny friend requests, and message other users texts, images, and videos. The technologies that I used to build this application are React, TailwindCSS, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore, Firebase Cloud Storage, and Netlify.
